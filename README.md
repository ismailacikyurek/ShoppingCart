# ShoppingCart

I designed an online shopping application. I took 20 products belonging to 4 different categories from https://fakestoreapi.com/. The user can filter these products. Can search by name. Using Firebase, he can add the product he likes to his cart. You can add the product you don't want to buy yet to your favorites.

Libraries I use:
-Firebase
-Alamofire
-Lottie
-Kingfisher
-Snapkit

Architecture: MVVM
